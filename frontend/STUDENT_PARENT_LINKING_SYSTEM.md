## 📊 Workflow

### Student-Parent Linking Process:

```
1. ADMIN adds students
   ↓
2. PARENT searches for student
   ↓
3. PARENT selects relationship (Parent/Guardian/Other)
   ↓
4. PARENT submits link request
   ↓
5. Request status: PENDING
   ↓
6. ADMIN reviews request in /admin/student-links
   ↓
7. ADMIN approves OR rejects (with reason)
   ↓
8. If APPROVED: Student appears in parent's "My Children"
   If REJECTED: Parent sees rejection reason
```
