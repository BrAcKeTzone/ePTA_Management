## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No students found"

**Solution:** Admin needs to add students first in `/admin/students`

### Issue: "Search returns no results"

**Solution:** Make sure you're searching by correct name or student ID

### Issue: Link request not showing

**Solution:**

1. Check in "Link Requests Status" section
2. Verify you're logged in as the correct parent
3. Refresh the page

### Issue: Can't approve/reject request

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you're logged in as ADMIN
2. Check if request is already processed
3. Verify backend is running
