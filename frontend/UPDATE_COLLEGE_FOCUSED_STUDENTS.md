# 🎓 Student Management Update - College-Focused System

## 📋 Changes Made

### Issue:

The system had grade-level filters (Elementary, Junior High, Senior High) which are not applicable for a **college-only** PTA management system.

### Solution:

Removed grade-level filters and updated the student form to be college-appropriate with proper placeholders.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. **Removed Grade Level Filters**

#### Before:

- ❌ All Students
- ❌ Elementary (K-6)
- ❌ Junior High (7-10)
- ❌ Senior High (11-12)

#### After:

- ✅ No filter tabs (all students shown by default)
- College-focused approach

---

### 2. **Updated Summary Cards**

#### Before:

4 cards displaying:

- Total Students
- Elementary Count
- High School Count
- With Parents

#### After:

2 cards displaying:

- **Total Students** - Shows total count
- **With Parent Linked** - Shows how many students have linked parents

---

### 3. **Added Academic Year Field**

Added a new required field for when the student enrolled:

**Field:** Academic Year Enrolled  
**Placeholder:** `YYYY-YYYY (e.g., 2024-2025)`  
**Required:** Yes  
**Example:** `2024-2025`, `2025-2026`

This is more relevant for college students than grade levels.

---

### 4. **Added Helpful Placeholders**

All form fields now have descriptive placeholders:

| Field         | Placeholder                     | Example    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| First Name    | `e.g., Juan`                    | Juan       |
| Last Name     | `e.g., Dela Cruz`               | Dela Cruz  |
| Student ID    | `YYYY-NNNNN (e.g., 2024-12345)` | 2024-12345 |
| Academic Year | `YYYY-YYYY (e.g., 2024-2025)`   | 2024-2025  |
| Birth Date    | (date picker)                   | 01/15/2000 |

## 🎯 Student ID Format

### Recommended Format: `YYYY-NNNNN`

**Components:**

- `YYYY` = Year enrolled (4 digits)
- `-` = Separator
- `NNNNN` = Sequential number (5 digits)

**Examples:**

- `2024-00001` - First student enrolled in 2024
- `2024-12345` - Student #12,345 from 2024
- `2025-00001` - First student enrolled in 2025

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Easy to identify enrollment year
- ✅ Unique identification
- ✅ Scalable (99,999 students per year)
- ✅ Sortable by year

---

## 🎓 Academic Year Format

### Format: `YYYY-YYYY`

**Examples:**

- `2024-2025` - Academic year 2024-2025
- `2025-2026` - Academic year 2025-2026

**Represents:**

- Start year (e.g., 2024) to end year (e.g., 2025)
- Typically spans August to July in Philippines

model Student {
  id             Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  studentId      String        @unique
  firstName      String
  lastName       String
  academicYear   String        @default("2024-2025")  // ✅ Supported
  birthDate      DateTime?
  // ... other fields
}
```
