# Fix: Dashboard Black Border Design Consistency

## Problem

The Admin and Parent dashboards had light gray borders (`border-gray-200`) which were inconsistent with other pages like Attendance, Contributions, etc. that use black/dark borders (`border-gray-900` or just `border`).

## Solution

Updated all dashboard components to use `border-gray-900` for consistent, professional black borders throughout the application.

## Files Modified

### 1. Admin Dashboard

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Header section: `border-gray-200` → `border-gray-900`
- ✅ Quick Actions container: `border-gray-200` → `border-gray-900`
- ✅ Quick Action buttons (4x): `border-gray-200` → `border-gray-900`
- ✅ System Overview card: `border-gray-200` → `border-gray-900`
- ✅ Financial Summary card: `border-gray-200` → `border-gray-900`

**Total changes:** 8 border updates

**Total changes:** 11 border updates

**File:** `frontend/src/components/DashboardCard.jsx`

**Changes:**

## Design Consistency

All components now follow the same border styling pattern:

```jsx
// Container borders
className = "border border-gray-900";

// Divider borders (between sections)

// Button/Card borders
className = "border border-gray-900";
```
