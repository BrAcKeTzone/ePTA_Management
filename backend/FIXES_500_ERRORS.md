# 🔧 500 Internal Server Error Fixes

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## 📋 Issues Fixed

The frontend was getting 500 Internal Server Errors from the following endpoints:

1. ❌ `GET /api/announcements/unread-count` - Missing endpoint
2. ❌ `GET /api/announcements/my-read-status` - Missing endpoint
3. ❌ `GET /api/projects/documents/public` - Missing service function
4. ❌ `GET /api/students/my-children` - Missing endpoint

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Announcements Read Tracking System**

#### Database Schema Changes

Added a new `AnnouncementRead` model to track which users have read which announcements:

```prisma
model AnnouncementRead {
  id             Int          @id @default(autoincrement())

  announcement   Announcement @relation(fields: [announcementId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  announcementId Int

  userId         Int

  readAt         DateTime     @default(now())

  @@unique([announcementId, userId])
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([announcementId])
}
```

Updated the `Announcement` model to include the relation:

```prisma
model Announcement {
  // ... existing fields
  readBy      AnnouncementRead[]
}
```

#### Service Functions Added

**File**: `src/api/announcements/announcements.service.ts`

1. **`markAnnouncementAsRead(announcementId, userId)`**

   - Marks an announcement as read by a user
   - Uses upsert to create or update read status
   - Returns void

2. **`getUnreadCount(userId)`**

   - Calculates unread announcement count for a user
   - Only counts active (published and not expired) announcements
   - Returns number

3. **`getMyReadStatus(userId, page, limit)`**
   - Returns announcements with their read status
   - Includes pagination
   - Returns announcements with `isRead` and `readAt` fields

#### Controller Functions Added

**File**: `src/api/announcements/announcements.controller.ts`

1. **`markAnnouncementAsRead`** - POST /:id/read
2. **`getUnreadCount`** - GET /unread-count
3. **`getMyReadStatus`** - GET /my-read-status

#### Routes Updated

**File**: `src/api/announcements/announcements.route.ts`

- Added authentication middleware to all routes
- Made `/active` endpoint public (no auth)
- Added new routes:
  - `GET /unread-count` (before /:id)
  - `GET /my-read-status` (before /:id)
  - `POST /:id/read`

### 2. **Students My Children Endpoint**

#### Controller Function Added

**File**: `src/api/students/students.controller.ts`

- **`getMyChildren`**: Gets authenticated user's approved/linked children
  - Uses existing service function `getApprovedStudentsByParentId`
  - Extracts user ID from auth middleware

#### Route Added

**File**: `src/api/students/students.route.ts`

- Added authentication middleware to all routes
- Added `GET /my-children` route (before /:id route)

### 3. **Projects Public Documents Endpoint**

#### Service Function Added

**File**: `src/api/projects/projects.service.ts`

- **`getPublicDocuments(filters)`**
  - Retrieves documents from public project updates
  - Filters by `isPublic: true`
  - Supports pagination, search, and project filtering
  - Parses attachments from JSON
  - Returns flattened document list

## 📦 Database Migration

Run the following command to apply schema changes:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

✅ **Completed successfully**

## ⚠️ Known Issues

The projects controller has several missing service functions for features that haven't been fully implemented:

- `getDocumentForDownload`
- `updateDocument`
- `deleteDocument`
- `updateProjectStatus`
- `getProjectAccomplishments`
- `createAccomplishment`
- And several others...

These functions are referenced in the controller but don't exist in the service. They should be implemented in a future update or the routes should be removed from the controller.

## 🎉 Success!

All critical 500 errors have been resolved. The backend API now properly supports:

- ✅ Announcement read tracking
- ✅ Unread count display
- ✅ Parent's children access
- ✅ Public project documents

**Status**: Ready for frontend integration testing! 🚀
