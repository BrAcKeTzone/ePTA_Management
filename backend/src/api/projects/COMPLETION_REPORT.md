## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication

- ✅ JWT token required on all endpoints
- ✅ Token validation via middleware
- ✅ User identity extraction

### Authorization (RBAC)

- ✅ Admin-only operations (11 endpoints):

  - Create, update, delete projects
  - Record, update, delete expenses
  - Create, update, delete updates
  - Generate reports
  - Update raised funds

- ✅ Public read access (9 endpoints):

## 💰 Financial System

### Automatic Calculations

```typescript

✅ fundingProgress = (totalRaised / fundingGoal) * 100
✅ budgetUtilization = (totalExpenses / budget) * 100
```

### Budget Constraints
