## Best Practices

### 1. Use Draft Mode

Create announcements as drafts first (`isPublished: false`), review them, then publish.

### 2. Set Expiry Dates

Always set expiry dates for time-sensitive announcements to keep the active list clean.

### 3. Use Appropriate Priority Levels

- Use URGENT sparingly for truly critical situations
- HIGH for important notices
- MEDIUM for regular announcements
- LOW for general information

### 4. Target Your Audience

Use targeted announcements to avoid information overload:

- Use SPECIFIC_PROGRAM for program-specific information
- Use SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL for year-specific information
- Use PARENTS for parent-only information

### 5. Test Notifications

When publishing important announcements, consider:

- Sending to a test group first
- Checking the notification result for failures
- Following up on failed deliveries

### 6. Batch Publishing

If you need to publish multiple announcements, add a delay between them to avoid overwhelming the email server.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Email Batching

- Emails are sent in batches of 10
- 1-second delay between batches
- Prevents email server rate limiting
- Returns detailed success/failure report

### Link Status Filtering

For targeted announcements (SPECIFIC_PROGRAM, SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL), only parents with APPROVED student links receive notifications. This ensures that only verified parent-student relationships receive relevant announcements.

### Notification Performance

For large audiences (100+ recipients):

- Expect ~1 minute per 100 recipients
- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Publishing operation returns immediately with notification promise
- Check notification result for success/failure counts
