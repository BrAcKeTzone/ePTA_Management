## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Target Audience Rules

- **SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL**: Requires `targetYearLevel` field
- Only parents with **APPROVED** student links receive targeted announcements

### Date Validation

- `expiryDate` must be after `publishDate`
- Both dates are optional
- Expiry automatically removes from active list

### Admin-Only Actions

- Create announcements
- Update announcements
- Delete announcements
- Publish/unpublish announcements

### Parent Access

- View active announcements
- View announcement details

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Announcement Not Showing in Active List

Check:

1. Is `isPublished = true`?
2. Has it expired? (`expiryDate < now`)
3. Is `publishDate` in the future?

### Notifications Not Sending

Check:

1. Email server configured in `.env`?
2. `sendNotifications` set to `true`?
3. Are there recipients for target audience?
4. Check notification result for error details

### No Recipients Found

Check:

1. Target audience has users?
2. For SPECIFIC_PROGRAM/YEAR_LEVEL: Are there students in that program/year?
3. Are student links APPROVED?

5. **Test First**: Try with small audience before mass sending
6. **Monitor Results**: Check notification results for failures
7. **Handle Failures**: Follow up on failed email deliveries
