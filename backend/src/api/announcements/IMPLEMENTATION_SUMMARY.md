# Announcements System Implementation Summary

## üéâ Complete Implementation

The Announcements System has been **fully implemented and is functional**. This document provides an overview of what was built.

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

**Enhanced Announcement Model:**

- `id`, `title`, `content` (existing)
- `priority` (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT)
- `targetAudience` (ALL, PARENTS, ADMINS, SPECIFIC_PROGRAM, SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL)
- `targetProgram` (for program-specific targeting)
- `targetYearLevel` (for year-level targeting)
- `isPublished` (draft vs published state)
- `publishDate` (when published)
- `expiryDate` (automatic expiry)
- `attachmentUrl` and `attachmentName` (file attachments)
- Proper indexes for performance

**New Enums:**

- `AnnouncementPriority`: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- `TargetAudience`: ALL, PARENTS, ADMINS, SPECIFIC_PROGRAM, SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL

### 2. Validation Layer

**File:** `src/api/announcements/announcements.validation.ts`

Comprehensive Joi validation schemas:

- `createAnnouncement` - Validates creation data
- `updateAnnouncement` - Validates update data
- `getAnnouncements` - Validates query parameters
- `publishAnnouncement` - Validates publish options
- `announcementIdParam` - Validates ID parameters
- `getPaginated` - Validates pagination

### 3. Service Layer

**File:** `src/api/announcements/announcements.service.ts`

**Functions Implemented:**

1. **`createAnnouncement(data)`**

   - Creates new announcement
   - Validates admin role
   - Validates target audience logic
   - Validates publish/expiry dates

2. **`getAnnouncements(filter)`**

   - Gets all announcements with filters
   - Supports search, priority, audience, published status
   - Pagination support
   - Sorted by priority and date

3. **`getActiveAnnouncements(page, limit)`**

   - Gets published, non-expired announcements
   - Main endpoint for parents
   - Automatic expiry filtering

4. **`getAnnouncementById(id)`**

   - Retrieves single announcement
   - Includes creator information

5. **`updateAnnouncement(id, data)`**

   - Updates existing announcement
   - Validates target audience logic
   - Prevents invalid combinations

6. **`deleteAnnouncement(id)`**

   - Permanently deletes announcement

7. **`publishAnnouncement(id, publishDate, sendNotifications)`**

   - Publishes announcement
   - Sends notifications to targeted recipients
   - Returns notification results (sent/failed counts)

8. **`unpublishAnnouncement(id)`**

   - Unpublishes announcement
   - Removes from active list

9. **`getAnnouncementStats()`**

   - Comprehensive statistics
   - Total, published, active, expired counts
   - Breakdown by priority and target audience

10. **`getTargetedRecipients(announcement)`**
    - Helper function
    - Identifies recipients based on target audience
    - Filters by program/year level for specific targeting
    - Only includes parents with APPROVED student links

### 4. Notification System

**File:** `src/utils/announcementNotification.ts`

**Functions:**

1. **`sendAnnouncementNotifications(options)`**

   - Sends emails to multiple recipients
   - Batch processing (10 emails per batch)
   - 1-second delay between batches
   - Returns success/failure counts with error details

2. **`sendSingleAnnouncementNotification(email, name, ...)`**
   - Sends email to single recipient
   - Priority-formatted subject lines
   - Professional email formatting

**Email Features:**

- Priority-based subject lines (`[High Priority]`, `üî¥ URGENT`)
- Personalized greeting with recipient name
- Professional formatting
- Attachment links
- PTA branding footer
- Auto-generated, no-reply notice

### 5. Controller Layer

**File:** `src/api/announcements/announcements.controller.ts`

**HTTP Handlers:**

1. `createAnnouncement` - POST /
2. `getAnnouncements` - GET /
3. `getActiveAnnouncements` - GET /active
4. `getAnnouncementById` - GET /:id
5. `updateAnnouncement` - PUT /:id
6. `deleteAnnouncement` - DELETE /:id
7. `publishAnnouncement` - PATCH /:id/publish
8. `unpublishAnnouncement` - PATCH /:id/unpublish
9. `getAnnouncementStats` - GET /stats

All wrapped with `asyncHandler` for error handling.

### 6. Routes Configuration

**File:** `src/api/announcements/announcements.route.ts`

Configured Express routes with:

- Validation middleware for body data
- Proper HTTP method mapping
- RESTful endpoint structure
- Route prioritization (specific before generic)

### 7. Documentation

**File:** `src/api/announcements/ANNOUNCEMENTS_API_DOCS.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:

- Overview and features
- All 9 endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Query parameters documentation
- Targeted announcement examples
- Email notification format
- Workflow examples
- Error responses
- Best practices
- Implementation notes

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Targeted Announcements

Send announcements to specific audiences:

- **ALL**: Everyone (admins + parents)
- **PARENTS**: All parents only
- **ADMINS**: All admins only
- **SPECIFIC_PROGRAM**: Parents of students in BSIT, BSCS, etc.
- **SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL**: Parents of students in 1st Year, 2nd Year, etc.

### ‚úÖ Priority System

Four priority levels:

- **LOW**: General information
- **MEDIUM**: Standard (default)
- **HIGH**: Important notices
- **URGENT**: Critical/time-sensitive (üî¥ marked in emails)

### ‚úÖ Publishing Controls

- **Draft Mode**: Create without publishing
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Set future publish date
- **Expiry Dates**: Automatic removal from active list
- **Publish/Unpublish**: Toggle visibility

### ‚úÖ Email Notifications

- Automatic notification on publish
- Batched sending (prevents server overload)
- Priority-based formatting
- Personalized messages
- Success/failure reporting

### ‚úÖ Attachment Support

- Attachment URL and name fields
- Displayed in email notifications
- Supports any file hosting service

### ‚úÖ Statistics & Reporting

Complete analytics:

- Total, published, active, expired counts
- Urgent announcement tracking
- Breakdown by priority
- Breakdown by target audience

## üìä Business Logic

### Audience Targeting Logic

```
ALL ‚Üí All users in system

PARENTS ‚Üí All users with role=PARENT

ADMINS ‚Üí All users with role=ADMIN

SPECIFIC_PROGRAM ‚Üí
  Parents who have students with:
  - program = targetProgram
  - linkStatus = APPROVED

SPECIFIC_YEAR_LEVEL ‚Üí
  Parents who have students with:
  - yearLevel = targetYearLevel
  - linkStatus = APPROVED
```

### Active Announcements Logic

```
isPublished = true
AND (expiryDate IS NULL OR expiryDate >= NOW())
```

### Email Batching Logic

```
For each 10 recipients:
  - Send emails in parallel
  - Wait for batch to complete
  - 1-second delay
  - Move to next batch
```

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Error Handling

- ApiError class for consistent error responses
- Validation at multiple levels (Joi, service logic)
- Database constraint violations
- Email sending failures tracked and reported

### Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Batch email sending
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient queries with Prisma

### Data Integrity

- Admin-only creation/updates
- Target audience validation
- Date validation (expiry after publish)
- Required fields enforcement

---

## üìù Usage Examples

### Create Draft Announcement

```javascript
POST /api/announcements
{
  "title": "Important Notice",
  "content": "Details...",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "targetAudience": "PARENTS",
  "isPublished": false,
  "createdById": 1
}
```

### Publish with Notifications

```javascript
PATCH /api/announcements/1/publish
{
  "sendNotifications": true
}

// Response includes:
{
  "announcement": {...},
  "notificationResult": {
    "sent": 150,
    "failed": 2,
    "errors": ["..."]
  }
}
```

### Get Active Announcements (Parent View)

```javascript
GET /api/announcements/active?page=1&limit=10

// Returns only published, non-expired announcements
```

### Targeted Announcement

```javascript
POST /api/announcements
{
  "title": "BSIT Students Update",
  "content": "Details...",
  "targetAudience": "SPECIFIC_PROGRAM",
  "targetProgram": "BSIT",
  "createdById": 1
}

// When published, only parents of BSIT students receive emails
```
