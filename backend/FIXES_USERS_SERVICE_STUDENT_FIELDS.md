# Fix: Users Service Student Fields Update

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Issue

After cleaning up the Student model to remove `program`, `yearLevel`, `academicYear`, and `section` fields, the `users.service.ts` file was still trying to select these non-existent fields when fetching user profiles with their linked students.

## Error Message

```
PrismaClientValidationError:
Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation

Unknown field `program` for select statement on model `Student`.
Unknown field `yearLevel` for select statement on model `Student`.
Unknown field `academicYear` for select statement on model `Student`.
```

## Root Cause

The `getUserProfile()` and `getUserById()` functions in `users.service.ts` were selecting old Student fields that no longer exist in the schema after the Student model cleanup.

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/src/api/users/users.service.ts`

#### Function: `getUserProfile()`

**Before:**

```typescript
students: {
  where: { linkStatus: "APPROVED" },
  select: {
    id: true,
    studentId: true,
    firstName: true,
    lastName: true,
    middleName: true,
    program: true,        // ❌ Removed
    yearLevel: true,      // ❌ Removed
    academicYear: true,   // ❌ Removed
    status: true,
    email: true,
    phone: true,
  },
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
students: {
  where: { linkStatus: "APPROVED" },
  select: {
    id: true,
    studentId: true,
    firstName: true,
    lastName: true,
    middleName: true,
    birthDate: true,      // ✅ Added
    yearEnrolled: true,   // ✅ Changed from academicYear
    status: true,
    linkStatus: true,     // ✅ Added
    email: true,
    phone: true,
  },
}
```

#### Function: `getUserById()`

**Before:**

```typescript
students: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    studentId: true,
    firstName: true,
    lastName: true,
    program: true,      // ❌ Removed
    yearLevel: true,    // ❌ Removed
    linkStatus: true,
  },
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
students: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    studentId: true,
    firstName: true,
    lastName: true,
    middleName: true,   // ✅ Added
    birthDate: true,    // ✅ Added
    yearEnrolled: true, // ✅ Added
    status: true,       // ✅ Added
    linkStatus: true,
    email: true,        // ✅ Added
    phone: true,        // ✅ Added
  },
}
```

### 2. `backend/src/api/announcements/announcements.validation.ts`

**Issue**: Validation schema referenced `programOptions` and `yearLevelOptions` arrays that relied on the removed Student fields.

**Before:**

```typescript
const programOptions = ["BSIT", "BSCS", ...];
const yearLevelOptions = ["1st Year", "2nd Year", ...];

targetProgram: Joi.string().valid(...programOptions).optional(),
targetYearLevel: Joi.string().valid(...yearLevelOptions).optional(),
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Removed arrays, kept fields as free-form strings
targetProgram: Joi.string().optional().allow(""),
targetYearLevel: Joi.string().optional().allow(""),
```

**Note**: The Announcement schema still has `targetProgram` and `targetYearLevel` fields for future flexibility in targeting announcements, but they're no longer validated against specific options since Student doesn't track these anymore.

## Impact

### Before Fix

- ❌ Getting user profile failed with validation error
- ❌ Getting user by ID failed with validation error
- ❌ API endpoint `/api/auth/me` returned 500 error
- ❌ User dashboard couldn't load user data

### After Fix

- ✅ User profile retrieval works correctly
- ✅ User by ID retrieval works correctly
- ✅ API endpoints return proper data
- ✅ User dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ Parent can see their linked students with new field structure

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Backend compiles without errors
- [x] Server starts successfully
- [x] No Prisma validation errors
- [x] `/api/auth/me` endpoint works
- [x] `/api/users/:id` endpoint works
- [x] User profile displays linked students correctly
- [x] Parent dashboard can load user data

## Affected Endpoints

- ✅ `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- ✅ `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (Admin)
- ✅ `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile

## Notes

- The `academicYear` field in the Contribution model is separate and unaffected (tracks contribution period, not student enrollment)
- The Settings model's `currentAcademicYear` field is also separate (tracks system-wide academic year)
- Announcement targeting by program/year level is now free-form instead of validated against specific options

**Status**: ✅ Resolved - Backend server running successfully
